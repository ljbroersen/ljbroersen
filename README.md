- Hi, my name is Lisa! I am originally from the Netherlands but currently living in Tokyo, Japan.
- I am a Fullstack Engineer with a background in translation and LQA (Language Quality Assurance).
- For tech, I am interested in Fullstack Development. Personally, I love talking about and consuming coffee, or reading a book in my free time.
- Currently, I am in the process of continuously improving my JavaScript/TypeScript skills, including frameworks like React, React Native and Next.js. However, I also have a genuine interest in Java, and want to dedicate a part of my free time improving my understanding of the language.
- Please do not hesitate to reach out to me through lj.broersen@gmail.com or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lisa-broersen/).
